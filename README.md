# Huffman Coding Project: Huffman using C++

Embark on a nostalgic journey with my C++ Huffman, a retro-inspired adventure that combines the simplicity of ASCII graphics with captivating gameplay. Immerse yourself in a world where creativity meets classic gaming.

## üìú Project Highlights:
- **Input Analysis:** The program takes user input in the form of text and performs a thorough analysis of the frequency of each character.
- **Huffman Tree Generation:** Witness the creation of the Huffman Tree, a fundamental structure used for encoding and decoding.
- **Character Encoding:** Each letter is meticulously encoded with variable-length Huffman Codes, ensuring optimal compression.
- **Encryption Process:** Experience the encryption process as the original text is transformed into a compact and encoded version.
- **Decryption Magic:** Unravel the encoded text back to its original form through the efficient Huffman Decoding process.

## üîç Explore the Bits:
The program meticulously displays each letter alongside its corresponding Huffman Code, offering insight into the compression algorithm's workings.

## üîí Before Encryption:
View the original text and its representation in the form of bits before undergoing the Huffman Coding encryption process.

## üîì After Decryption:
Witness the successful decryption process, where the encoded bits are transformed back into the original text.

## ‚ö° Technologies Used:
Programming Language (C++)
